# Covariance Measure Tests (COMETs) in Python <img src='pycomets/inst/pycomets-pkg.png' align="right" height="135" />

The Generalised [1] and Projected [2] Covariance Measure tests (GCM, PCM) can be
used to test conditional independence between a real-valued response $Y$ and
features/modalities $X$ given additional features/modalities $Z$ using any
sufficiently predictive supervised learning algorithms. The `pycomets` Python
library implements these covariance measure tests (COMETs) with a user-friendly
interface which allows the user to use any sufficiently predictive supervised
learning algorithm of their choosing. An R version of the package is available
[here](https://github.com/LucasKook/comets).

Here, we showcase how to use `pycomets` with a simple example in which $Y$ is
not independent of $X$ given $Z$. More elaborate examples including conditional
variable significance testing and modality selection on real-world data can be
found in [3].

```{python, results='hold'}
n = 150
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
X = rng.normal(0, 1, (n, 2))
Z = rng.normal(0, 1, (n, 2))
Y = X[:, 0]**2 + Z[:, 1] + rng.normal(0, 1, n)
```

The output for the GCM test, which fails to reject the null hypothesis of
conditional independence in this example, is shown below. The residuals for the
$Y$ on $Z$ and $X$ on $Z$ regressions can be investigated by calling
`pcm.plot()` (not shown here).

```{python, results='hold'}
gcm = GCM()
gcm.test(Y, X, Z)
# fig, ax = gcm.plot()
```

The PCM test can be run likewise. The PCM test correctly rejects the null
hypothesis of conditional independence in this example.

```{python, results='hold'}
pcm = PCM()
pcm.test(Y, X, Z, rng=rng)
# fig, ax = pcm.plot()
```

Different regression methods can supplied for both GCM and PCM tests using the
`reg_*` arguments (for instance, `reg_YonZ` in `PCM().test()` for the regression
of $Y$ on $Z$). Pre-implemented regressions can be found in the `regression`
module and include regression forests (`RF`), classification forests (`RFC`),
the linear model (`LM`), cross-validated kernel ridge regression (`KRR`), and
regression and classification Xgboost (`XGB`, `XGBC`). For instance, in the
code chunk below, we use a KRR for both $Y$ on $Z$ and $X$ on $Z$ with different
kernel choices and grids for hyperparameter tuning.

```{python, results='hold'}
gcm = GCM()
gcm.test(Y, X, Z,
         KRR(kernel="rbf", param_grid={'alpha': [0.1, 1, 10]}),
         KRR(param_grid={'kernel': ('linear', 'rbf'), 'alpha': [0.1, 1]}))
```
